    This story begins long ago in the year 1009, when it was told that there was
    hidden treasure was lost in the city of Dwarka, India. For hundreds of years
    people mistakenly believed it would be easy to find, but they were wrong,
    everyone that went to find the treasure never returned.Many years later a
    boy named Sai heard this story from his grandfather, who heard it from his
    grandfather. Actually for many generations this story had been passed on in
    the Maram family. Sai's father thought it was all a lie, but Sai through
    differently he believed the story was true but as he grew older he forgot
    it. You are in December 2021, a year has passed since Sai resigned from his
    last job and became a full time traveller.But sai is running out of savings,
    soon he will have no money left. It was a cool spring morning; and the sun
    was shining brightly as Sai walked down the street. Suddenly Sai remembered
    the story of the lost treasure. Without delay Sai ran to his grandfather’s
    house to ask about the treasure and Dwarka.

          You spend all day looking for clues but found nothing. You realised
          that this couldn't have been the right place because it was Jal Bhawan
          was built recently and the story of lost treasure is with Maram family
          for generations.

          You both agreed to look at the map again and check if you missed
          anything. You notice that handles of glasses are different from each
          other. You:- Wait! Sai I think something is different about these
          handles. Sai:- Yes I thought because they are very old and some
          mishandling caused it.

          You try to fix it and notice a very fine paper attached inside the
          connecting joints. You pull it out and it says:- "Shining star, oh
          shining star
              How silvery and glittery my jewels are
              Find the treasure deep down below
              A place of worship you should go". You think this your first clue to get to the starting point. You think its refering to temple of old Dwarka but Sai thinks it about Jal Bhawan a temple in new Dwarka. Sai:- "Where do you want go?"
